Operator precedence
- The order in which the operands are evaluated in. 
- Applies when multiple operators are used in a single expression

() - highest precedence of any operator
If we use the two operators of equal precedence they are sometimes evaluated left to right.

List from highest to lowest precedent:

Hight to low:
1 -()
2 - increments and decrements (right to left)
3 - not and unary operators (right to left)
4 - Arithmetic operators - multiplication, division, modulus, addition and subtraction (left to right)
5 - And, and or
6 - Comma operator (lowest precedence)

Summary: 
- Operators are evaluated according to their precedence, which is somewhat complex.
