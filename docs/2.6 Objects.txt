Objects:
- Consist of a series of comma-separated key value pairs within curly braces
The key are value pairs are known as properties
The identifiers are called keys
Their values are values

Create objects
1. Object literal syntax
2. Using the new keyword

The dot is a special type of operator known as a property accessor.

To declare an object:
var obj = {};
var obj2 = {name: 'Silvia'};

obj2.name = 'Silvia';
obj2['name'] = 'Silvia';

Summary:
- Access properties with . or [] syntax
- Add properties with . and =
- We can create primitives using new - But don't!
