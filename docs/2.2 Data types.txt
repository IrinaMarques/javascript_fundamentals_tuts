Data types
- Loosely typed language
- Few types

1. Primitives
- number - primaty data type
- string - primaty data type
- boolean - primaty data type
- undefined - special data type
- null - special data type

1.1 Primary data types
Number:
- Any positive or negative integer or decimal
- Greater than 5e-324
- Less than 1.797693134623157e+308

- Octal
- Exponential
- Hexadecimal

If we try to use a number outside of the supported range we get:
- +Infinity
- -Infinity
- Infinity is a special number
If we try to do something invalid to a number (e.i. divide it by a string)
- NaN - Not a Number (another special number)
- Nothing is equal to NaN not even itself, use ISNaN() to check

2. String
- a sequence of characters within quotes
- can be double or single quotes, single are recommended
- quotes can be nested, but must match

3. Boolean
- only two values - true or false
- javascript also has truthy and falsey values

Falsey values:
- false
- 0
- ''
- null
- undefined
- Nan
All other values are truthy!

1.2 Special data types
- Undefined 
- Null 

When we declare a variable but not the value we get the undefined data type.
In some situations it is treated as the same as the null data type.
Undefined it's not a variable but can be used as the value for a variable. 
Null ia a data type that is used in place of any regular value.

2. Composite data types - multiple entities:
- Array
- Object

Array
- container for multiple values
- fixed numerical indices
- indices are sero-based
- [0,1,2,3]
- all arrays have a length property
- have methods used to operate on the array items

Objects
- container for key value pairs
- each key value is separated by a comma
- key and value separated by colon
- similar to an array except they have indeces based on words instead of numbers

Summary:
Primitives: number, string, boolean, undefined, null
Composite: array, object
