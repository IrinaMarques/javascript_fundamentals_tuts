Variables:
- Container for a value
- JavaScript is weakly/dynamically typed
- No need to specify variable types
- Variable types can change
- Sometimes we don't know a variable's type

Declare a variable with the var keyword followed by the name or identifier of the variable

var
- Variable.

var x;
- Variable x is undefined.

var x = 42;
- Now the var contains the numeric value 42.

Rules:
- Variable name should be descreptive to give the indication of what it contains
- First letter of each word should be capitalized execept the first letter - meaningOfLife
- Use any Unicode character in an identifier - start with an underscore, the dollar sign or a letter

Summary:
- Declare variables with var
