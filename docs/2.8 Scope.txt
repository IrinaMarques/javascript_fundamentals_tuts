Scope:

Defines:
- The visability/acessibility of variables in our code
- Global scope is the top level scope that contains all other scopes
- Global scope === window object

Globals
- Global variables are visible everywhere 
- Can be overwritten by others scripts

The window object:
- Numerous properties and methods for us to use



How to create a new Scope?
 
Function scope:
- Functions create their own scope
- Variables created in a function are local to the function - they are local variables instead of global variables
- Invisible/inaccessible outside a function

- Functions can acess all their own variables
- And variables in the same scope as the functions themselves

- Only functions can create a scope
- Global variables are leaky and pollute the global scope

Avoid the global scope:
- Use an immediately invoked function to create a local scope for your code

Summary:
- Scope
- Visibility of variables in our code
- Global var visible everywhere
- Functions create their own scope
- Local variables only visible to their function
- Exploit this to protect var from the global scope
